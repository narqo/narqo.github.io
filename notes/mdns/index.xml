This worked fine but this &amp;ldquo;stack of boards&amp;rdquo; behind the sofa in the centre of our small flat bugged me a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year I decided to reorganise the cluster, turning it into a &lt;em>wireless-to-wired island&lt;/em>, which I could relocate anywhere within the flat, without doing any special cable management, while staying cheap and avoid stacking the appartment with even more gadgets. After going through a number of trials and errors, the final setup looks as the following:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Different colours contour the connections between two logical subnets â€” more on that later. Here what we have on the schema (top to bottom):&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
