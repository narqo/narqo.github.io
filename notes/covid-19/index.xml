For the up-to-date information in your region, consult with your local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything I list below are the steps I found relevant, after I&amp;rsquo;ve self-tested positive for COVID in Berlin, in the end of January 2022&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="friday-28th-january-2022"&gt;Friday, 28th January 2022&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up with some &lt;em&gt;mild&lt;/em&gt; symptoms of cold. On the day before I worked from home, and only had a usual an hour-long walk around Prenzlauer Berg — Mitte after the workday. The rapid antigen test (&lt;em&gt;Schnelltest&lt;/em&gt;) was negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still working from home, I took a &amp;ldquo;quiet Friday&amp;rdquo; at work, to simply focused on some mundane routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for a short walk in the afternoon, bought some grocery, and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="saturday-29th-january"&gt;Saturday, 29th January&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anywhere better or worse: mostly had a runny nose and a dry throat. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait in the line for a quick-test, so I&amp;rsquo;ve just walked around the city for an hour and went home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sunday-30th-january"&gt;Sunday, 30th January&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt the same as it&amp;rsquo;d been the day before, although the dry throat started to feel a bit more intense. Walked around for an hour, came home, made some coffee ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple hours later I started to cough. I made a self-test — we still had some at home — and,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here we are! Welcome to the &amp;ldquo;two-stripes&amp;rdquo; club&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
