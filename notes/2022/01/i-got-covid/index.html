Everything I list below are the steps I found relevant, after I&rsquo;ve self-tested positive for COVID in Berlin, in the end of January 2022.
Friday, 28th January 2022
I woke up with some mild symptoms of cold. On the day before I worked from home, and only had a usual an hour-long walk around Prenzlauer Berg — Mitte after the workday. The rapid antigen test (Schnelltest) was negative.
While still working from home, I took a &ldquo;quiet Friday&rdquo; at work, to simply focused on some mundane routines.
I went for a short walk in the afternoon, bought some grocery, and headed home.
Saturday, 29th January
Didn&rsquo;t feel anywhere better or worse: mostly had a runny nose and a dry throat. I didn&rsquo;t want to wait in the line for a quick-test, so I&rsquo;ve just walked around the city for an hour and went home.
Sunday, 30th January
It felt the same as it&rsquo;d been the day before, although the dry throat started to feel a bit more intense. Walked around for an hour, came home, made some coffee ;)
A couple hours later I started to cough. I made a self-test — we still had some at home — and,

Here we are! Welcome to the &ldquo;two-stripes&rdquo; club.

<p><a href=https://twitter.com/tvii/status/1487801108005220352>https://twitter.com/tvii/status/1487801108005220352</a></p>

<p><a href=https://twitter.com/felixge>Felix Geisendörfer</a> on Twitter was very genus to outline the next steps, following his own recent experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re required to seek a PCR test.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re recommended, not required, to isolate until PCR results come in.</li>
<li>Isolation ends on day 10 after first test. A negative test on day 7 ends isolation early (can be rapid).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Felix also pointed to a Praxis, who did (free) PCR tests (<a href=https://praxis-arkonaplatz.termin-direkt.de/public/)>https://praxis-arkonaplatz.termin-direkt.de/public/)</a>. As it turned out, they were in the walking distance from my home, I&rsquo;ve booked an appointment with them for the next closest date (the next day&rsquo;s morning).</p>
<h3 id=monday-31st-january>Monday, 31st January</h3>
<p>In the morning I informed my colleagues and the office-management about the situation, so they could do a <em>contact-tracking-thing</em>, and warned the folks, who&rsquo;d been in the office with me, in the first half of the previous week 😇</p>
<p>During the day my cough became a bit stronger. I had a small fever (37℃).</p>
<p>The appointment for the PCR was at 10:30.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;testing facility&rdquo; was simply two opened windows at the Praxis&rsquo;s ground floor, at the corner of Arkonaplatz 5/Swinemünder Str. 117. There was a small queue at the place, but the overall procedure took only about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind before going to a free PCR test:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need an appointment.</li>
<li>You need to have an insurance card (<em>Gesundheitskarte</em>) with you.</li>
<li>You need to show &ldquo;a proof&rdquo; of a positive quick-test (or any &ldquo;rationale&rdquo; for the PCR test).</li>
<li>You need to fill up a short form, while standing in front of the window.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my case, I&rsquo;ve showed the same photo I&rsquo;d posted on Twitter, with the &ldquo;two-stripes thing&rdquo; as &ldquo;a proof&rdquo;. But I doubt that will do in the future.</p>
<p>(<em>An extremely convenient thing about living in Prenzlauer Berg, is that lots of people in the &ldquo;service jobs&rdquo; speak English with no too big of a problem.</em>)</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve told me I should expect the results via email in 48 hours.</p>
<h3 id=tuesday-1st-february>Tuesday, 1st February</h3>
<p>Got some &ldquo;positive&rdquo; news 🥁</p>
<p>I received an email from the laboratory with my PCR-test results (the results were ready just in 7 hours, according to the timestamps in the PDF):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-RNA <strong>positiv!</strong></p>
<p>Ct-Wert 26.62</p>
<p>Varianten-PCR B.1.1.529 (OMICRON-Variante, &ldquo;Variant of concern&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>If I got it right, the &ldquo;Ct-Wert&rdquo; number shows how quickly (in cycles) the test turned positive, i.e. the more cycles they passed, the less virus were in the sample. It sounds somewhere similar to fuzz-testing to me :)</em></p>
<p>So far I felt similar as on the day prior: &ldquo;some&rdquo; cough — &ldquo;some&rdquo; dry throat — &ldquo;some&rdquo; runny nose — 37℃.</p>
<p>The head felt empty, although that&rsquo;s a usual thing in this time of the year, when I could never tell for sure, if the way I felt was due to the changing weather, a light-flue, or because I&rsquo;ve been starring at the screen for the whole day.</p>
<p>I updated the office about the PCR results, as they&rsquo;d asked yesterday.</p>
<p>In order to add the test results to my Corona-Warn app profile, I had to call to the app&rsquo;s hot-line to receive a one-time-password (<em>TAN</em>) for this test. After a brief survey a person from the hot-line called back with a 10-symbols TAN, they&rsquo;ve generated for me. This entire part felt odd but that how it worked at the moment.</p>

<p>I guess, that counted as the &ldquo;first day&rdquo; of my <em>stay-home-quarantine</em>.</p>
<h3 id=wednesday-2nd-february>Wednesday, 2nd February</h3>
<p>So far it all felt like a regular, <em>annoying</em> cold.</p>
<p>The runny nose turned into a stuffed nose. The temperature stayed at 37℃.</p>

<h3 id=thursday-3rd-february>Thursday, 3rd February</h3>
<p>Even though I felt okay during the previous two days, today I felt much better. &ldquo;Nasic&rdquo; helped with stuffed nose (<em>this is not a medical advice!</em>). But some light &ldquo;dry&rdquo; cough was still here.</p>
<p>I made a self antigen test out of being bored. The test was still positive. At least it was re-assuring to know, these tests didn&rsquo;t show false-negative results.</p>
<figure><img src=/images/2022/covid-02-03-quick-test.jpg alt="A positive quick-test, 03/02/2022" width=450>
</figure>
<p>Our office wrote that I will need to send them a &ldquo;confirmation of the quarantine&rdquo; (or a &ldquo;sick note&rdquo;) from the health department (<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>). I had no idea what &ldquo;<em>Gesundheitsamt</em>&rdquo; actually was, so I emailed the Praxis, where I took the PCR, for if they could provide these documents to me. They replied that this wasn&rsquo;t on them, and that I will get this confirmation after my quarantine ends (<em>I guess &ldquo;automagically&rdquo;</em>). I also checked with our office if that was in the alignment with what they meant.</p>
<h3 id=friday-4th-february>Friday, 4th February</h3>
<p>In Russian, we called this &ldquo;<em>The dream has come true</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a letter from <em>Gesundheitsamt</em>, stated that I was on the quarantine from 31.01 until 10.02. Should I have no symptoms, and a positive (antigen) test after the seventh day, I could end my quarantine earlier (so far I felt fine, and I totally expected this would be the case).</p>
<p><em>Generally, I don&rsquo;t think, a person shut in a self-isolation, was supposed to pick the letters from their mailbox, located at the house&rsquo;s entrance, several stores below their flat. &ldquo;Luckily&rdquo; for me, until today, Olga — my wife — hasn&rsquo;t been on the quarantine yet. All these days her antigen test was negative, so she&rsquo;s been our family&rsquo;s postlady for this whole week</em> 📯</p>
<p>The letter included the link to the district&rsquo;s health department&rsquo;s recommendations (<a href=http://berlin.de/ba-pankow/ip)>http://berlin.de/ba-pankow/ip)</a>, where I had to go through a survey (<em>Indexpersonen-Meldeformular</em>) for PCR-positive people, to outline the story. One question there was about my possible guesses for where, or from whom, I&rsquo;d caught COVID. To be frank, with the overall number of people around, infected with the &ldquo;little O&rdquo; (<em>o mikron</em>), I didn&rsquo;t care &ldquo;where&rdquo;: could be in a grocery store, could be in a tram, or simply on a walk.</p>
<h3 id=saturday-5th-february>Saturday, 5th February</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;happy&rdquo; line from this morning&rsquo;s rapid test was barely visible, comparing to how it had been two days before. But the test was still positive 😐</p>
<figure><img src=/images/2022/covid-02-05-quick-test.jpg alt="A positive quick-test, 05/02/2022" width=450>
</figure>
<p>Olya was also tested positive yesterday, with PCR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ct-Wert&rdquo; 17.36, and her condition was way <em>less mild</em> than mine. It wasn&rsquo;t any way close to something &ldquo;major&rdquo; but fever, very intense cough, overall weakness, etc. didn&rsquo;t look fun.</p>
<h3 id=sunday-6th-february>Sunday, 6th February</h3>
<p>My stuffed nose and occasional dry cough felt annoying this morning, but they&rsquo;ve <em>just blended into the lazy weekend</em>, as the day progressed. It&rsquo;s been already one week since the first positive test. Time flies ⏰</p>
<h3 id=monday-7th-february>Monday, 7th February</h3>
<p>My rapid self-test was finally negative. Tomorrow I could leave my self-quarantine, make a rapid test in one of the city&rsquo;s test centres, to get an official confirmation of being a <em>healthy individual</em>.</p>
<figure><img src=/images/2022/covid-02-07-quick-test.jpg alt="A positive quick-test, 07/02/2022" width=450>
</figure>
<h3 id=tuesday-8th-february>Tuesday, 8th February</h3>
<p>I went to a test centre in the morning to avoid waiting in the queue. The rapid test was negative, meaning I was officially released from the quarantine!</p>

<p>Also, I got an email from the Praxis, where I made the PCR, with a certificate of recovery, to add to my Corona-Warn app profile. Now I had the &ldquo;full house&rdquo; of badges</p>
