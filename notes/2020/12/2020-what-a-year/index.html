For many people, this was the worse, the weirdest, the most depressing year; the year we wish was a bad dream. With all the respect for the terrible things, lots of people went through, for me, it was a year to remember.
In 2020 I learned how to work from home. It’s still not super fun, but it’s possible. As I look at that now, there are obvious benefits: I can start and end my day much more freely; I currently don’t feel much pressure when willing to go for a walk or a run at 11:00, or when I finish my workday at 16:00 (I tend to start around 8:30 while at home). But that being said, I still don’t consider staying full-remote and want to go back to the office, co-working, or a random coffee bar.
In 2020 I bought a bicycle. After tree years in Berlin, I’m now &ldquo;one of those people&rdquo; :) Can’t say I’m super excited about the acquisition, generally because I live in the walking distance from the office. With the bicycle, the “trip” is less than ten minutes shorter. I have to wait at the traffic lights a lot; plus have to spend extra minutes to lock/unlock the bicycle.
In 2020 we adopted a cat. The CAT, who’s now called Gagarin! He came from the middle of &ldquo;nowhere-Russia&rdquo; as a frightened little kitten and spent the first month under the bed, avoiding walking under the light. And now, after four months he comes to have a nap on our pillow (and on my head) at 7:00, as a way to signal that it’s time to feed him.
In 2020 I walked, on average, one kilometre per day more, than in the previous year (5 km vs 4 km currently; winter isn’t much of a walking season for me). A bit of surprise but, overall, I walked 1000 km less this year, than I made in 2019. I bet that’s because we didn’t travel much (obviously) and didn’t have a chance to explore a new city, neither in later Spring, nor on Christmas.
In 2020 I assembled my four nodes Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster, but I haven’t made much use of it yet. As promised to my self in December 2019, during the year I learned and touched some new Kubernetes details, and I have tons of things I still want to delve into and understand on a more in-depth level of details.
In 2020 I started to learn Rust. I tried that in 2018 and in 2019. But this year, I actually spent a month or two writing code, not only reading/watching/listening to/following the content. It feels refreshing. Programming for embedded devices and game-dev are the most attractive fields, which I want to explore further with Rust.
In 2020 I had two job interviews. None of them was successful for me, although I tend to believe that I’ve passed both. I have plans to draft a note about the essential questions one must ask the HR during the first call.
In 2020 I did and learned, and read, and listen to, and watched, and thought about a bunch of things.
In 2021 I will do even better."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="https://vladimir.varank.in/notes/2020/12/2020-what-a-year/"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2020-12-29T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2020-12-29T00:00:00+00:00"><style>:root{--background-color: #fff;--text-color: #131313;--header-color: #111;--link-color: rgb(0, 16, 161);--link-underline-color: rgba(0, 16, 161, 0.3);--link-active-color: rgb(231, 19, 19);--link-active-underline-color: rgba(231, 19, 19, 0.7)}html{font-size:16px;height:100%;margin:0;padding:0}body{background:var(--background-color);color:var(--text-color);display:grid;grid-template-rows:auto 1fr auto;font-family:Charter,Georgia,serif;font-size:1.1rem;line-height:1.4;margin:5px 1%;min-height:calc(100vh - 10px)}h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6{color:var(--header-color);font-family:Athelas,Georgia,serif;line-height:1;margin:1.5em 0 .7em}h1{font-size:40px;margin:.5em 0 .2em}a{color:#0010a1;color:var(--link-color);text-decoration-color:var(--link-underline-color)}a:hover,a:active{color:#be0000;color:var(--link-active-color);text-decoration-color:var(--link-active-underline-color)}ul,ol{box-sizing:border-box;max-width:760px;padding:0}ol{padding-left:1.2em}ul>li{list-style:none;margin:.5em 0}pre{line-height:1.4;margin:1em 1.5em}code{font-family:Menlo,Consolas,monospace;font-size:15px}pre code{font-size:14px}hr{border:none;border-bottom:1px solid;width:90%}.main-nav{display:flex;letter-spacing:.3em;padding-bottom:16px}.main-nav a,.main-nav span{margin-right:.6em;letter-spacing:0}.main-nav-item-active{color:var(--link-active-color);text-decoration-color:var(--link-active-underline-color)}.main-content{max-width:940px}.main-footer{font-size:14px;margin:0}.article{margin:0 0 50px}.article-head{font-size:28px}.article-head h1,.article-head h2{font-size:1em;margin-top:1em}.article-head h2{margin-bottom:0}.article-meta{font-size:14px;line-height:1;padding:5px 0 0}.tag{margin:0 0 0 7px}</style></head><body><nav class=main-nav><a href=/>Vladimir Varankin</a>
